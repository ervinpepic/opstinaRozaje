Disables right click context menu on images to help deter leeches from stealing images.

== Description ==
The No Right Click Images Plugin Plugin uses JavaScript to change the right click action on IMG tags to disable the context menu. It disables the context menu on images only so other right click actions, such as links, should work normally.

Optionally the plugin can be disabled for logged in users.

Since it uses JavaScript, it targets more images than using plugins that filter pages and rewrite the tag. The plugin will find many images generated in scripts or pasted into posts and comments, that similar plugins will not find.

It is impossible to keep people from stealing images that appear in web pages, but this plugin will deter casual theft from surfers who do not want to interpret HTML or dig into the browser cache.

Smart Phone support is hit or miss. Some web pages rely very much on clickable images and this suppresses some actions, so if an image is large enough to fill a screen, the page may not be able to scroll. It depends very much on your WordPress theme and how it displays images.

Images uploaded via the Wordpress Media uploader will open in a window if clicked. The image will not be protected, so be sure to indicate that there should be no action if the image is clicked at the time you upload the image.

Some browsers prevent JavaScript from changing the browser context menu and this plugin will not be effective in those cases. At best, this plugin will prevent right clicking or dragging images on some browsers.

The plugin no longer tries to replace images with a dummy image. This method hardly ever worked and broke many web pages. If you want to go back, the 2.5 version may be available in the WordPress archive.
  
== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I click on an image to open it and then I can save it =
When you added the image to WordPress you specified this behavior. When you insert an image you have to specify that you don't want to have a click on the image open the image. It is up to you to protect your images by not opening the image on a click.
If you are able to click on an image to display the image in a new window, it is then outside of WordPress and can't be protected.
= I have a Slideshow or Gallery and users can right click on the images in the gallery. =
Special image presentation plugins that use jQuery or other Javascript systems override the behavior of this plugin. When they load they take over and my plugin can't help you. You need to contact the authors of the gallery and ask they they disable the right click event and drag events inside their plugin.
